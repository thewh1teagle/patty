# Patty

Cross platform system PATH manager.

# Introduction

`Patty` enables you to manage and modify the system `PATH` variable on `Windows`, `Linux`, and `macOS`. 

It's particularly useful for `CLI` apps that need to be accessible in `PATH`. 

`Patty` achieves this by modifying the registry in `Windows` and adjusting `RC` files in `Linux`/`macOS`, such as `zshrc` or `bashrc`.
